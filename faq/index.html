                        <h4><i class="fa fa-calendar"></i>Can I just come with my group and pay at the door?</h4>
                        <p>We take appointments and payments in advance but we do accept walkins if we have available slots and timing permits.</p>

                        <h4><i class="fa fa-users"></i>I have decided which room I would like to do, and I know the number of people I'm bringing. What next?</h4>
                        <p>You can book online or call us at 619-642-0095 to book. Payments have to be settled during the time of booking.</p>

                        <h4><i class="fa fa-user-secret"></i>Will there be strangers that will play with my group as well?</h4>
                        <p>If you book all the seats allocated to the room, you won't be grouped with others. If you book some seats but not all, then others may purchase those available seats and be grouped with you.</p>

                        <p>If it's your private group, we can potentially accommodate your request depending on the number of additions. However, if your group is playing the game with other parties, then we cannot increase the number of available seats.</p>

                        <h4><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i>Late arrivals - what happens if my party is late?</h4>
                        <p>PARTIES MUST BE ON TIME. We ask that your party arrives 15 minutes prior to your booking start time you will need to sign waivers, use the restroom, and be introduced to the rules of the room. We cannot accommodate late parties because we have scheduled bookings after your appointment; therefore, we must start on time. Late parties cannot be rescheduled or refunded since others would have had to be turned away for your reservation. Please make sure to map our address, plan your route to make sure you arrive on time, and allocate time for parking.</p>

                        <p>The neighborhood has street parking, meter parking spots, and plenty of paid parking lots available but Escape Game SD does not owe its own parking lot. We advise your party to take parking into consideration so you are on time for your appointment.</p>
